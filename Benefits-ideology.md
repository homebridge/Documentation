# Why?
 We have two main reasons to why we are switching to this new sysytem.
..* Maintenance: We recently noticed there seem to be a lot of plugins out there that are no longer being maintained and as people fork and make their own repos tracking changes and functionality has become difficult
..* Stability: Developers all have their own varying degrees of testing and certain plugins cause a lot of trouble for other Homebridge instances
# The Benefits
1. With this setup in place there will always be someone on the other end who is active that can merge your PR and close issues etc. Hopefully with more closed issues, the greater number of people use moderators can get to help other people.
2. Stability, we are setting up a "certification process", which will have various rankings to allow a user to easily identify currently maintained and working plugins
3. Usability. As part of this "certification process" we will be ensuring that the plugin has under gone certain "stress testing" as well as imposing new guidelines such as support dynamic platforms.
4. The much coveted guided setup process with GUI. Many people have asked for an easier way to setup Homebridge, with this deployment system we will have developers create a 'config.schema.json' that @oznu's Config-UI-X will read and give the user a prompted setup process to enter all the required credentials and finish the setup process. 

# Why Discord?
..* As some of you long time users might have noticed we have had a lot of people join Slack since this project started, as we don't make any money of this project we operate with the Free Tier on Slack. This limits us to X amount of messages which can become somewhat annoying when you go to look for a message in your history from a month ago to find out it's delted.
1. Discord allows unlimited history
2. Better integration with HomeBrew bots 
3. More control over Channels

### The Slack team will still be monitored however we are hoping to have everyone who is active on Slack move over to the Discord Server. The Slack invite code has been removed from the readme.md and the Discord link has been added.
