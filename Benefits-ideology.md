# Why?

We have several main reasons to why we are switching central hub for the Homebridge community

* Community: The Homebridge community while being very strong and active is lacking a central hub, to pull people together and share common goals and objectives for the community.

* Stability: Developers all have their own varying degrees of coding expertise, testing and certain plugins cause a lot of trouble for other Homebridge instances

* Maintenance: We recently noticed there seem to be a lot of plugins out there that are no longer being maintained and as people fork and make their own repos, determining the current working version has become difficult and challenging for end users.

# The Benefits

~~1. With this setup in place there will always be someone on the other end who is active that can merge your PR and close issues etc. Hopefully with more closed issues, the greater number of people use moderators can get to help other people.~~

2. Stability, in the community we will be ensuring that plugins are being actively supported and managed by 'maintainers'.  And plugins no longer functional or supported, will be deprecated and dropped from the community.

3. Usability. As part of this "certification process" we will be ensuring that the plugin has under gone certain "stress testing" as well as imposing new guidelines such as support dynamic platforms.

4. The much coveted guided setup process with GUI. Many people have asked for an easier way to setup Homebridge, with this deployment system we will have developers create a 'config.schema.json' that @oznu's Config-UI-X will read and give the user a prompted setup process to enter all the required credentials and finish the setup process. By requiring a changelog.md to be included it will allow an easy to view changelog without having to visit individual Github repos to check the commit notes.

# Why Discord?
* As some of you long time users might have noticed we have had a lot of people join Slack since this project started, as we don't make any money of this project we operate with the Free Tier on Slack. This limits us to X amount of messages which can become somewhat annoying when you go to look for a message in your history from a month ago to find out it's delted.

1. Discord allows unlimited history

2. Better integration with HomeBrew bots

3. More control over Channels

### The Slack team will still be monitored however we are hoping to have everyone who is active on Slack move over to the Discord Server. The Slack invite code has been removed from the readme.md and the Discord link has been added.
