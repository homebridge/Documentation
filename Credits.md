# H1 Credit:
 ..* @Khaost, One of the founder fathers of Homebridge and has been continous active.
 ..* @Nfarina, The founding father of Homebridge as a platform. Without him Homebridge would not exist and all of us would be stuck waiting on native Homekit support from companies and/or having to pay for an upgraded hub/bridge for homekit support.
 ..* @NorthernMan54, has been an awesome sounding board for ideas and his experience with publishing on NPM has been invaluable
 ..* @Oznu, We asked him how we could make a prompted/guided user setup process happen and he has been more than happy to work with us on making this a reality.
 ..* @Taitems, The creator of the icon and putting together a demo for a website for Homebridge

 # H2 And finally a thank you to our userbase for the continous support and bearing with us as we make the transition over.
