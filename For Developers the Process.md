# Plugin Publishing Process

1 - Transfering plugin to the github HomeBridge organization

Once you feel that your plugin is complete, and ready to join the organization, we will transfer the repository to the homebridge organization.  We will then setup yourself as the author as the "owner" of the transferred repository, giving yourself full access and control of it.

2 - Publishing to NPM under the HomeBridge organization

Before publishing to NPM, we are looking at some sort of regression testing process to determine if the plugin is well behaved enough for publishing.  Once it has passed, it will published to NPM under the "HomeBridge" NPM account.  Details of the regression testing are TBD at this time.

3 - Ongoing Maintenance of your plugin

Ongoing management and maintenance of your plugin would stay with yourself as the author, but the wider community would be available for consulting on best practices for plugin coding, documentation and other topics.
